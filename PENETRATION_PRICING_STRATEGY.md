## Cost Structure Analysis

### Per-User Monthly Costs

| Cost Component | Core Plan | AI Plan | Edge Plan |
|----------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Infrastructure (hosting, DB, CDN) | $2.50 | $3.50 | $5.00 |
| LLM API Costs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure) | $0.00 | $8.00 | $15.00 |
| Support & Customer Success | $1.50 | $2.00 | $3.00 |
| Sales & Marketing (amortized) | $1.00 | $1.50 | $2.00 |
| Development & Overhead | $2.00 | $3.00 | $5.00 |
| **Total Cost per User/Month** | **$7.00** | **$18.00** | **$30.00** |

### Penetration Pricing Formula
```
Monthly:  Price = Cost / (1 - Margin) = Cost / 0.80  (20% margin)
Annual:   Price = Cost / (1 - Margin) = Cost / 0.85  (15% margin, ~11% discount vs monthly)
3-Year:   Price = Cost / (1 - Margin) = Cost / 0.88  (12% margin, ~18% discount vs monthly)
```

### Base USD Pricing (20%/15%/12% Margins)

| Plan | Monthly Cost | **Monthly Price** (20% margin) | **Yearly Price** (15% margin) | **3-Year Price** (12% margin) |
|------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Core** | $7.00 | **$9/mo** ($108/yr) | **$8/mo** ($96/yr) | **$8/mo** ($288/3yr) |
| **AI** | $18.00 | **$23/mo** ($276/yr) | **$21/mo** ($252/yr) | **$20/mo** ($720/3yr) |
| **Edge** | $30.00 | **$38/mo** ($456/yr) | **$35/mo** ($420/yr) | **$34/mo** ($1,224/3yr) |

**Note:** Annual pricing offers ~11% discount with 15% margin, 3-year offers ~18% discount with 12% margin to incentivize long-term commitments while maintaining profitability.

## Why Penetration Pricing Works for Accute

### 1. **Unique AI Psychology Profiling**
- Competitors require 24-36 months to build similar capabilities
- First-mover advantage creates switching costs

### 2. **Network Effects**
- More users = better psychology profiling models
- Data network effects create moat

### 3. **Viral Growth**
- Accounting firms refer to each other
- Low price removes barrier to trying Accute

### 4. **Competitive Moat**
- By the time competitors match AI capabilities, Accute has:
  - 100,000+ users
  - Superior ML models trained on real data
  - Brand recognition as "AI accounting platform"

### 5. **Margin Expansion Path**
- Once market share is established (Year 3), gradually increase prices
- Target 35-40% margins by Year 4-5
- Users with switching costs will stay despite price increases

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. **Cash Flow Management**
- Annual/3-year billing upfront to manage cash flow
- Incentivize yearly commitments with 22% discount

### 2. **Cost Control**
- Monitor LLM API costs closely
- Implement usage limits for free/low-tier plans
- Optimize prompts to reduce token usage

### 3. **Competitor Response**
- If TaxDome/Karbon drop prices, we still have:
  - AI Psychology Profiling (unique feature)
  - Multi-agent orchestration (not replicable quickly)
  - Better AI capabilities (95/100 vs 38-46/100)

### 4. **Margin Monitoring**
- Track actual costs monthly
- Adjust pricing if margins drop below 15%
- Exit strategy: Raise prices in Year 2 if needed

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Q1 2026 (Immediate)
- ✅ Update pricing tables in database
- ✅ Launch new pricing on website
- ✅ Marketing campaign: "AI accounting for everyone"

- Add volume discounts for 10+ users

### Phase 4: 2027 onwards

- Target 35-40% margins by 2028

## Success Metrics

## Conclusion

Penetration pricing with 20% margins is the right strategy to:
1. **Rapidly gain market share** before competitors catch up
2. **Establish Accute as the AI accounting leader**
3. **Build data moats** through psychology profiling network effects
4. **Create switching costs** that allow future margin expansion

The 24-36 month window to establish dominance is closing. Aggressive pricing is the key to winning this market before TaxDome, Karbon, and Canopy can replicate our AI capabilities.

# ACCUTE - PRODUCT FEATURES & COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

## Executive Summary

**Accute** is the world's first AI-native accounting workflow automation platform. Unlike legacy competitors (TaxDome, Karbon, Canopy) that have forms, workflows, and inbox features that require **manual operation**, Accute has specialized AI agents (Cadence, Forma, Echo, Scribe, Parity, Relay) that **AUTOMATE** these features.

**The Key Differentiator:**
- ❌ TaxDome has organizers → ✅ Accute has **Forms** + **Forma agent** that intelligently creates and populates them
- ❌ TaxDome has pipelines → ✅ Accute has **Workflows** + **Cadence agent** that automates execution

  ├─ my-custom-agent/
  │   ├─ manifest.json          # Agent configuration
  │   ├─ backend/
  │   │   └─ index.ts           # Backend logic
  │   └─ frontend/
  │       └─ AgentUI.tsx        # Frontend interface
```

2. **Define Manifest** (JSON-based configuration)
```json
{
  "slug": "my-custom-agent",
  "name": "My Custom Agent",
  "description": "Automates custom accounting workflows",
  "category": "automation",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "frontendEntry": "./frontend/AgentUI.tsx",
  "backendEntry": "./backend/index.ts",
  "capabilities": [
    "extract_data",
    "validate_entries",
    "generate_reports"
  ],
  "subscriptionMinPlan": "professional",
  "pricingModel": "per_token",
  "pricePerToken": 0.001,

```typescript
// Check if user can access agent
async function checkAccess(userId, agentSlug, orgId, userRole) {
  const agent = getAgent(agentSlug);
  const userPlan = await getUserSubscriptionPlan(orgId);
  
  // Check subscription requirement
  if (!meetsSubscriptionRequirement(userPlan, agent.subscriptionMinPlan)) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Check organization installation
  const installation = await getAgentInstallation(agentSlug, orgId);
  if (!installation) {
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **AI API 500 Error - LLM Credentials Not Configured**

**Symptom:**
- AI agents return 500 Internal Server Error
- AI features (Luca chat, Cadence, Forma, Relay, Echo, Scribe, Parity) don't work
- Error message: "LLM configuration not found" or similar

**Root Cause:**
The AI API requires LLM (Large Language Model) credentials to be configured in the system. Accute uses encrypted database storage (not environment variables) for API keys to ensure maximum security with AES-256-GCM encryption.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Verify ENCRYPTION_KEY is Set**
The `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable must be at least 32 characters. This key is used to encrypt/decrypt API keys stored in the database.

```bash
# Check if ENCRYPTION_KEY exists
echo $ENCRYPTION_KEY

# If not set, generate a new one:
node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"

# Add to your environment variables
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-key-here"
```

**Step 2: Configure LLM Credentials via Settings Page**

1. **Log in to Accute** with Admin or Super Admin account
2. **Navigate to Settings** (`/settings` route)
3. **Scroll to "LLM Provider Configuration" section**
4. **Click "Add LLM Configuration" button**
5. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Name**: e.g., "Production OpenAI" or "Development Anthropic"
   - **Provider**: Select from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or Anthropic
   - **Model**: 
     - OpenAI: `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-turbo-preview`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`
     - Anthropic: `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
     - Azure: Your deployment name (e.g., `gpt-4-deployment`)
   - **API Key**: Your provider's API key
     - OpenAI: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
     - Anthropic: Get from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
     - Azure: Get from Azure Portal
   - **Azure Endpoint** (Azure only): e.g., `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com`
   - **Azure API Version** (Azure only): e.g., `2024-12-01-preview`
   - **Set as Default**: Check this box for your primary AI provider

6. **Click "Test Connection"** to verify credentials work
7. **Click "Save Configuration"** to encrypt and store

**Step 3: Verify Configuration**

After saving, you should see your LLM configuration listed in the Settings page. The API key is encrypted and stored securely in the database with AES-256-GCM encryption.

**Step 4: Test AI Features**

Try using any AI feature:
- Open Luca chat widget (bottom-right corner)
- Ask a question like "Hello, can you help me?"
- If configured correctly, Luca will respond

**Security Notes:**
- ✅ API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- ✅ Each encrypted key uses a unique initialization vector (IV)
- ✅ Authentication tags prevent tampering
- ✅ Keys are never stored in plaintext
- ✅ Per-organization isolation ensures multi-tenant security
- ✅ ENCRYPTION_KEY is stored as environment variable (not in database)

**Multi-Provider Setup:**
You can configure multiple LLM providers and switch between them:
- Primary: OpenAI GPT-4 (high quality, higher cost)
- Backup: Anthropic Claude Sonnet (good quality, moderate cost)
- Development: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo (faster, lower cost)

Set one as "Default" for general use. Specific AI agents can be configured to use specific providers based on their needs.

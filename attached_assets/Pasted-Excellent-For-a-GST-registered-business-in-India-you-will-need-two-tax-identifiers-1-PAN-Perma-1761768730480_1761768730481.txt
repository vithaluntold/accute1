Excellent. For a GST-registered business in India, you will need two tax identifiers:

1. PAN (Permanent Account Number)  
   - Purpose: Unique identifier for tax payments and business verification.  
   - Format: 10 alphanumeric characters (e.g., AAAPL1234C).  

2. GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number)  
   - Purpose: Identifies your GST registration for invoicing and filings.  
   - Format: 15 characters where:
     • First 2 digits = state code (36 for Telangana)  
     • Next 10 characters = your PAN exactly  
     • 13th character = entity number (1–9, A–Z)  
     • 14th character = always ‘Z’  
     • 15th character = check digit  

Please fill out the Contact & Company Information form below with the company name, contact details, PAN, and GSTIN. Don’t share these values in chat—enter them securely on the form.

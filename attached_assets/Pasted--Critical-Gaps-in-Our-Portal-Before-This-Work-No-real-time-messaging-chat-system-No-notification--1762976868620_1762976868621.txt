❌ Critical Gaps in Our Portal (Before This Work)
No real-time messaging/chat system
No notification system (email, in-app, push)
No progress tracking or visual workflow status
No automated reminders for pending items
Limited document upload/download functionality
No file preview or fillable forms
No help center or onboarding guides
✅ Phase 1 Backend Implementation (COMPLETED)
1. Enhanced Notification System

Database Schema Updated (shared/schema.ts + SQL migration)
Added organizationId for multi-tenant support
Added priority (low, medium, high, urgent)
Added actionUrl for deep linking to actions
Added resourceId and resourceType for context
Added isActioned flag to track completion
Added readAt and actionedAt timestamps
2. Notification API Endpoints Created (server/routes.ts)

GET /api/notifications - Fetch notifications with pagination
GET /api/notifications/unread-count - Get unread badge count
PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read - Mark single notification as read
POST /api/notifications/mark-all-read - Bulk mark all as read
3. Action Center API Endpoint Created

GET /api/client-portal/action-center?filter=all|waiting_on_me|waiting_on_firm
Unified dashboard for all pending items
Filters by responsibility (TaxDome-style "Waiting for action")
Returns summary statistics (totalPending, overdueCount, etc.)
Infrastructure ready for real data aggregation

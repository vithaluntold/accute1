## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already use Karbon"
**Response:** "Karbon is excellent for workflow management, but it lacks AI intelligence. Accute combines Karbon-style workflows with 10 specialized AI agents that actually do the work. Think of it as Karbon + AI team members that never sleep."

### "AI isn't accurate enough for accounting"
**Response:** "That's exactly why we built Six Sigma quality controls. Every AI action goes through validation checks, and our AI Psychology Assessment monitors agent performance in real-time. We achieve 99.99966% defect-free quality—better than manual processes."

### "We're concerned about security"
**Response:** "Security is our foundation, not an afterthought. We have 347 security policies, row-level security on 87 tables, PKI digital signatures, and comprehensive audit trails. We're built for SOC 2 compliance from day one."

### "What if OpenAI changes their pricing or terms?"
**Response:** "We support OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Anthropic Claude. You can switch providers with one configuration change—no vendor lock-in. Your firm stays in control."

### "Our team isn't technical enough"
**Response:** "Neither are 95% of accounting teams. That's why we built visual workflow builders, natural language AI agents, and a Notion-inspired UI. If your team uses email and spreadsheets, they can use Accute."

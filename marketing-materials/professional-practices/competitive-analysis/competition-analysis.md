### Win Strategy Against TaxDome

**Positioning:**  
*"Building on the workflow management foundation TaxDome pioneered, we're introducing AI-powered execution—the next chapter in practice automation."*

**Key Messages:**
1. **Show the AI difference:** 
   - Demo Luca preparing a 1040 (2 hours vs. 8 hours manual)
   - Show client asking Luca questions at 11 PM getting instant answers
   - Display quality metrics TaxDome can't provide

2. **Highlight cost savings:**
   - 26% lower price per user
   - No annual lock-in required
   - Volume discounts kick in at 50 users

3. **Emphasize quality:**
   - Six Sigma metrics dashboard
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Comprehensive audit trails

4. **Address "but TaxDome is the market leader":**
   - *"That's like saying 'we use manual spreadsheets because Excel is the market leader.' TaxDome pioneered practice management, but we're pioneering AI-native practice management. The difference is execution vs. management."*

**Proof Points:**
- Tax prep: 75% time reduction (8 hours → 2 hours)
- Client questions: 24/7 instant AI responses (TaxDome = manual only)
- Error rate: 99.99966% accuracy (TaxDome = no SLA)
- Cost: $49 vs. $66/user (26% savings)

**Common Objections & Responses:**

**"We're already on TaxDome and it works fine"**
→ *"TaxDome is excellent—they've earned their market leadership. We're not suggesting you replace them. Instead, we're introducing complementary AI capabilities. While TaxDome manages workflows beautifully, we add AI agents that execute tasks—like preparing returns, answering client questions 24/7, reviewing documents. We learned from TaxDome's workflow management excellence and focused our innovation on AI execution. Would you like to see how this could complement your existing setup?"*

**"TaxDome has unlimited storage, you only have 100GB"**
→ *"Fair point on storage. Our Professional tier includes 100GB, and Enterprise has unlimited like TaxDome. But here's what TaxDome doesn't have: AI agents that cut your tax prep time by 75%. Let me show you the ROI—for a 20-person firm, the time savings pay for the entire platform 85x over. Storage is included; productivity is the real value."*

**"TaxDome has 10,000 customers, you're new"**
→ *"You're right that TaxDome is established—they pioneered modern practice management. But remember, every industry leader eventually gets disrupted by better technology. TaxDome was that disruption to Thomson Reuters. We're the next evolution—AI-native automation. Would you want to be an early adopter who gained 2-3 years of competitive advantage, or wait until everyone has it?"*

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We're already on TaxDome and it works fine"

**Response:**  
*"TaxDome is an excellent choice—they've set the standard for modern practice management and have earned their market leadership. We're not asking you to replace what works. Instead, we're introducing something complementary: AI agents that execute tasks alongside workflow management. While TaxDome organizes your work beautifully, Luca can prepare tax returns in 2 hours instead of 8, answer client questions at 2 AM, and review documents for errors automatically. We learned from what TaxDome did right and added the AI execution layer. And we've priced it competitively at $49/user to make innovation accessible."*

**Show:**
- Luca agent preparing 1040 in 2 hours vs. 8 hours manual
- Client portal AI answering questions 24/7 (enhancing the portal experience)
- Side-by-side pricing: $49 vs. $66/user (competitive, not claiming superiority)
- Quality dashboard showing Six Sigma metrics (additive capability)

### "TaxDome has unlimited storage, you only have 100GB on Professional tier"

**Response:**  
*"You're absolutely right—TaxDome's unlimited storage is a strong offering, and we match that in our Enterprise tier. For Professional tier, we offer 100GB with affordable expansion options. We made a different trade-off decision: rather than compete on storage alone, we invested in AI capabilities that drive productivity. For a 20-person firm, our AI automation creates about $500K in annual value through time savings. Both approaches have merit—TaxDome focuses on comprehensive infrastructure, we focus on AI-powered productivity. Many firms find the combination of our competitive pricing and AI capabilities addresses their priorities."*

**Show:**
- ROI calculator showing $500K productivity gains
- Luca agent demo (our differentiated capability)
- Storage options: Enterprise tier = unlimited included, Professional = expandable

### "TaxDome is the market leader with 10,000 customers—you're new"

**Response:**  
*"You're absolutely right, and TaxDome's success speaks to the quality of their platform—they've earned the trust of thousands of firms. We have deep respect for what they've built. We're not claiming to replace them overnight; we're introducing innovation in a specific area: AI-powered task execution. Think about how TaxDome itself started—they were new once too, bringing workflow management innovation to an industry dominated by Thomson Reuters. We're following that same pattern of respectful innovation, focusing on AI capabilities while learning from TaxDome's success in areas like user experience and workflow design. Some firms prefer proven solutions, others want early access to emerging capabilities. Both are valid choices."*

**Show:**
- AI agent capabilities (our innovation area)
- Time-to-value comparison (one of our strengths)
- 30-day risk-free pilot proposal (low-risk evaluation)

### "We already use Karbon and are happy with it"

**Response:**  
*"That's great! Karbon is excellent for workflow management. Here's the key difference: Karbon helps your team manage workflows more efficiently, but your team still does all the work manually. Accute provides both the workflow management AND AI team members who actually execute tasks—like preparing tax returns, reviewing documents, answering client questions 24/7. Think of it as Karbon + 10 AI employees who never take vacation."*

**Show:**
- Luca agent preparing 1040 in 2 hours vs. 8 hours manual
- Client portal question answered by AI at 11 PM
- Document review by Veritas agent in 15 minutes

### "AI isn't accurate enough for accounting work"

**Response:**  
*"You're absolutely right to be skeptical—accuracy is non-negotiable in our profession. That's exactly why we built Six Sigma quality controls. Every AI action goes through validation checks, our AI Psychology Assessment monitors performance in real-time, and we achieve 99.99966% defect-free quality. That's actually BETTER than the industry average of 96.6% for manual work. Plus, you maintain full audit trails and human review checkpoints wherever you need them."*

**Show:**
- Quality metrics dashboard
- Audit trail for AI-prepared tax return
- Performance monitoring screenshots

### "We're concerned about data security and client confidentiality"

**Response:**  
*"Security isn't an afterthought for us—it's our foundation. We have 347 security policies, row-level security on all 87 database tables, PKI digital signatures for document authenticity, and comprehensive audit trails for SOC 2 compliance. Your clients' data is isolated using enterprise-grade multi-tenancy. We're built to the same standards as your banking systems."*

**Show:**
- Security architecture diagram
- Compliance certifications
- Audit trail examples

### "What happens if OpenAI changes their pricing or shuts down?"

**Response:**  
*"Great question about vendor risk. We support three AI providers: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Anthropic Claude. You can switch providers with a single configuration change—no code changes, no data migration. Your firm stays in complete control of which AI provider you use and can change anytime."*

**Show:**
- LLM configuration screen
- Multi-provider architecture

### "Our staff isn't technical—will they actually use this?"

**Response:**  
*"Neither are 95% of accounting teams, which is why we designed Accute like Notion and Linear—tools your staff probably already know. Visual workflow builders, natural language AI agents, and a clean interface. If your team can use email and Excel, they can use Accute. We also provide onboarding training and ongoing support."*

**Show:**
- Visual workflow builder
- Natural language chat with Luca
- Mobile app demo

### "We can't afford to switch tools right now"

**Response:**  
*"I understand—switching costs are real. That's why we offer a phased rollout: start with one practice area (like tax) or one team (like onboarding). You keep your existing tools running and only migrate when you see results. Most firms see ROI within 6 months, and the productivity gains pay for the transition."*

**Offer:**
- 30-day pilot with 5-10 users
- Phased rollout plan
- ROI calculator showing break-even

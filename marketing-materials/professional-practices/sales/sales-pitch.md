## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already use Karbon and are happy with it"

**Response:**  
*"That's great! Karbon is excellent for workflow management. Here's the key difference: Karbon helps your team manage workflows more efficiently, but your team still does all the work manually. Accute provides both the workflow management AND AI team members who actually execute tasks—like preparing tax returns, reviewing documents, answering client questions 24/7. Think of it as Karbon + 10 AI employees who never take vacation."*

### "AI isn't accurate enough for accounting work"

**Response:**  
*"You're absolutely right to be skeptical—accuracy is non-negotiable in our profession. That's exactly why we built Six Sigma quality controls. Every AI action goes through validation checks, our AI Psychology Assessment monitors performance in real-time, and we achieve 99.99966% defect-free quality. That's actually BETTER than the industry average of 96.6% for manual work. Plus, you maintain full audit trails and human review checkpoints wherever you need them."*

- Quality metrics dashboard
- Audit trail for AI-prepared tax return
- Performance monitoring screenshots

### "We're concerned about data security and client confidentiality"

**Response:**

We have 347 security policies, row-level security on all 87 database tables, PKI digital signatures for document authenticity, and comprehensive audit trails for SOC 2 compliance. Your clients' data is isolated using enterprise-grade multi-tenancy. We're built to the same standards as your banking systems."*

**Show:**
- LLM configuration screen
- Multi-provider architecture

### "Our staff isn't technical—will they actually use this?"

**Response:**  
*"Neither are 95% of accounting teams, which is why we designed Accute like Notion and Linear—tools your staff probably already know. Visual workflow builders, natural language AI agents, and a clean interface. If your team can use email and Excel, they can use Accute. We also provide onboarding training and ongoing support."*

**Show:**
- Visual workflow builder
- Natural language chat with Luca
- Mobile app demo

### "We can't afford to switch tools right now"

**Response:**  
*"I understand—switching costs are real. That's why we offer a phased rollout: start with one practice area (like tax) or one team (like onboarding). You keep your existing tools running and only migrate when you see results. Most firms see ROI within 6 months, and the productivity gains pay for the transition."*

- Phased rollout plan

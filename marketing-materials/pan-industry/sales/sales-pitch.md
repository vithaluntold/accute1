## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already use Zapier/Make and it works fine"

**Response:**  
*"That's great for simple if-this-then-that automations. Here's the difference: Zapier connects apps and moves data, but Accute deploys AI agents that actually make decisions and take actions. For example, Zapier can notify you when an invoice arrives—Accute can read the invoice, validate it against purchase orders, flag discrepancies, route for approval, and process payment. All with 99.99966% accuracy."*

**Show:**
- Complex workflow with AI decision points
- Quality metrics dashboard
- Cost comparison: Zapier tasks vs. Accute workflows

### "RPA failed for us before—why is this different?"

**Response:**  
*"Traditional RPA requires developers to code every edge case, breaks when UIs change, and has no intelligence. Accute uses AI agents that understand context, adapt to changes, and handle exceptions. Plus, our visual builder means business users create workflows in days, not months. And unlike RPA, we guarantee Six Sigma quality with real-time monitoring."*

**Show:**
- Visual workflow builder (no code required)
- AI agent handling edge case
- Deployment timeline comparison

### "How can you guarantee 99.99966% accuracy?"

**Response:**  
*"We built Six Sigma quality controls into every layer. AI Psychology Assessment monitors agent performance in real-time. Validation checks at every workflow step. Comprehensive audit trails for debugging. And if an agent's performance drops below threshold, it's automatically paused and escalated. We actually track this metric—it's not marketing speak."*

**Show:**
- Quality metrics dashboard
- AI Psychology Assessment screenshot
- Audit trail example

### "We're concerned about AI hallucinations affecting our business"

**Response:**  
*"Valid concern. That's why we use manifest-driven architecture—AI agents follow explicit rules and validation steps, not free-form generation. Critical decisions require multiple validation checkpoints. And you can configure human-in-the-loop approvals for high-stakes workflows. The AI augments your team; it doesn't replace judgment."*

**Show:**
- Manifest configuration
- Validation checkpoints
- Human approval workflows

### "What's your disaster recovery plan?"

**Response:**  
*"We're built on enterprise-grade infrastructure with 99.9% uptime SLA. Multi-region deployment with automatic failover. Real-time data replication. 15-minute Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). Plus comprehensive audit logs so you can reconstruct any workflow execution if needed."*

**Show:**
- Architecture diagram
- SLA documentation
- Disaster recovery procedures

### "Can we self-host this?"

**Response:**  
*"Our standard offering is cloud-hosted with enterprise security. For highly regulated industries or specific compliance requirements, we offer dedicated cloud instances. True self-hosting requires an enterprise contract—happy to discuss based on your needs."*

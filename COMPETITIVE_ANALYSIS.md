## Implementation Details

### Task Dependencies (Q1, 8 weeks)

**Database Schema**:
```typescript
// New table
task_dependencies:
  id: serial
  predecessorTaskId: varchar (FK to workflow_tasks)
  successorTaskId: varchar (FK to workflow_tasks)  
  dependencyType: enum('finish_to_start', 'start_to_start', 'finish_to_finish', 'start_to_finish')
  lagDays: integer (optional delay)
  createdAt: timestamp

// Add to workflow_tasks
criticalPathFlag: boolean
totalSlack: integer (hours)
```

**Features**:
- Visual dependency editor in task details
- Critical path calculation engine
- Gantt chart dependency arrows
- "Blocked by" and "Blocking" badges
- Auto-update dependent task dates when predecessor changes

**Testing**: Create 10-task workflow with dependencies, verify critical path highlighting

### Unified Inbox (Q2, 8 weeks)

**Architecture**:
```typescript
// Normalized schema
conversations:
  id: varchar
  organizationId: varchar
  clientId: varchar (optional)
  subject: string
  type: enum('email', 'sms', 'chat', 'portal')
  participants: json (user IDs)
  lastMessageAt: timestamp
  
messages:
  id: varchar
  conversationId: varchar (FK)
  senderId: varchar
  content: text
  messageType: enum('email', 'sms', 'chat', 'portal')
  isRead: boolean
  receivedAt: timestamp
  attachments: json
```

**Components**:
- Unified message list (combines all channels)
- Filter by channel, client, read/unread
- Threaded view with conversation history
- Compose new message (choose channel)
- @mentions with auto-complete
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

**Integration Points**:
- Email: IMAP sync worker
- SMS: Twilio webhook
- Chat: Existing WebSocket
- Portal: New message endpoint

### Custom Report Builder (Q3, 8 weeks)

**Query DSL**:
```typescript
{
  entity: 'time_entries' | 'invoices' | 'clients' | 'projects',
  filters: [
    { field: 'status', operator: 'equals', value: 'paid' },
    { field: 'date', operator: 'between', value: ['2026-01-01', '2026-12-31'] }
  ],
  groupBy: ['clientId', 'month'],
  aggregations: [
    { field: 'hours', function: 'sum', alias: 'total_hours' },
    { field: 'revenue', function: 'sum', alias: 'total_revenue' }
  ],
  orderBy: [{ field: 'total_revenue', direction: 'desc' }]
}
```

**UI**:
- Drag-drop fields from entity list
- Visual filter builder (no SQL knowledge required)
- Aggregation selector (sum, avg, count, min, max)
- Chart type selector (bar, line, pie, table)
- Save as template
- Schedule delivery

### External Integrations (Q4, 8 weeks)

**Zapier Connectors**:
- Triggers: New client, Invoice paid, Task completed, Document uploaded
- Actions: Create task, Send message, Update client
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Webhook delivery with retry logic

**QuickBooks/Xero**:
- OAuth connection flow
- Sync invoices (bi-directional)
- Sync clients and contacts
- Map chart of accounts
- Real-time sync vs scheduled batch

**Webhook Framework**:
```typescript
webhooks:
  id: varchar
  organizationId: varchar
  url: string
  events: string[] (array of event types)
  secret: string (for HMAC signature)
  isActive: boolean
```

## Prioritization Framework

### Churn Prevention (Must-Have)
1. **Task Dependencies** - Can't model complex workflows
2. **Gantt Charts** - Standard planning tool
3. **Unified Inbox** - TaxDome's killer feature
4. **Document Version Control** - Compliance requirement

### Enterprise Sales Enablers
1. **SSO/SAML** - Enterprise security requirement
2. **SOC 2 Compliance** - Enterprise trust
3. **Custom Report Builder** - Decision-making
4. **IP Whitelisting** - Enterprise security

### Competitive Differentiators
1. **Visual Automation Builder** - Better than ClickUp
2. **AI Quotes/Proposals Bot** - AI advantage
3. **Forecasting** - Predictive intelligence
4. **Skill-Based Assignment** - Smart resource allocation

### Technical Dependencies
```
Task Dependencies → Gantt Chart → Workload View
Task Dependencies → Timeline View
Unified Inbox → Threaded Conversations
Unified Inbox → Scheduled Reports (delivery)
Document Version Control → Document Comparison → Track Changes
Time Tracking → Resource Allocation → Workload View
```

## Quick Wins (1-2 weeks each)

These can be implemented immediately for fast impact:

1. **Calendar View** (4 weeks → can be 2 weeks with off-the-shelf library)
2. **Time-Off Calendar** (4 weeks → can be 2 weeks leveraging existing calendar)
3. **Payment Portal UI** (4 weeks → can be 2 weeks using existing Stripe integration)
4. **Enhanced Client Self-Service** (4 weeks → can be 2 weeks adding forms to existing portal)
5. **Mobile Push Notifications** (3 weeks → can be 1 week with FCM)
6. **Threaded Conversations** (3 weeks → can be 2 weeks adding conversation_id)

**Total Quick Wins**: 6 features in 10-12 weeks

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **SOC 2 audit delays** | HIGH | Start Q3, hire compliance expert, use pre-audit checklist |
| **Unified inbox data migration** | MEDIUM | Build migration scripts, test with sample data, rollback plan |
| **Gantt library limitations** | MEDIUM | Evaluate 3 libraries (Planview, react-gantt, custom), prototype early |
| **QuickBooks API rate limits** | LOW | Implement queue system, batch operations, caching |

### Resource Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Team burnout (162 weeks)** | HIGH | 20% buffer time, rotate features, avoid crunch |
| **Key engineer attrition** | MEDIUM | Knowledge sharing, documentation, pair programming |
| **Scope creep** | MEDIUM | Strict feature freeze per quarter, defer to next quarter |
